# Audit Onboarding Logging

Audit all onboarding steps for logging quality per LOGGING.md:
- Story: 3-5 key moments logged at INFO
- Supporting detail at DEBUG  
- Errors at ERROR with context
- Consistent style: lowercase, past tense, concise
- No noise: rendering, routine operations, redundant logs
